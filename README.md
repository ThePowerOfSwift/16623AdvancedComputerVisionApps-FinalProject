# 16623AdvancedComputerVisionApps-FinalProject

Title: Please provide the title of your project, followed by the names of all team members. Teams may include up to two students (special permission can be obtained for a team of three although there
must be a very good reason).

Summary: Summarize your project in no more than 2-3 sentences. Describe what you plan to do and what mobile vision problem you will be working on. See 16623.courses.cs.cmu.edu/ideas for
example project ideas.

Background: If your project involves taking advantage of computational speedups available on your iOS device - such as box filters, inverse composition in the LK algorithm, NEON intrinsics, OpenGL
ES, Accelerate Framework, binary descriptors such as FAST and BRIEF, etc. - describe theirapplication and why they are necessary in more detail. If your project involves something around
using your device in a mobile fashion - for example virtually rendering an object in your room - then describe what components of your solution are unique to a mobile device (the high-speed camera,
GPS, IMU, Gyro?).

The Challenge: Describe in a few sentences why the problem is challenging. Could you solve your problem using just a few pre-existing functions in OpenCV? Try to state explicitly what you are
hoping to learn by doing this project and how is it related to mobile computer vision? A flow chart or visual depiction of what you are trying to do would be good here. Some questions to consider:
• Does the challenge lie in making an existing vision algorithm more efficient in iOS? 
• Are you trying to solve a real-world problem that can only be solved through a combination of computer vision and mobile computing?

Goals & Deliverables: Describe the deliverables or goals of your project.
• In a couple of sentences separate your goals into what you PLAN TO ACHIEVE (what you believe you must get done to have a successful project and get the grade you expect) and an
extra goal or two that you HOPE TO ACHIEVE if the project goes really well and you get ahead of schedule.
• Describe what success looks like and how it can be evaluated. For example, if your project is to measure the velocity of a baseball being thrown in front of an iOS device, how will you
validate that it works? Screen shots of the App in action? A speed benchmark run across a variety of videos? A live video of the app in action? It will NOT be enough to simply provide
the Xcode project - you will need to provide evidence that you have achieved your goal.
• How realistic is it for your team to get what it needs to get done within the allotted time? Remember you only have a few weeks to get this project completed.

Schedule: Produce a schedule for your project. Your schedule should have at least one item to do per week per participant. List what your plan to get done each week from now until the 11th of
December deadline.
